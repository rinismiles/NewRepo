"I designed and implemented a scalable hybrid automation framework integrating Selenium, Cucumber BDD, TestNG, and REST Assured. The framework supported UI, API, and DB validation, reduced regression time by 65%, and was fully integrated into Jenkins CI/CD pipelines."

We implemented a Hybrid Framework combining:

Page Object Model (POM)

Data Driven (Excel + JSON)

BDD using Cucumber

TestNG Runner

CI/CD with Jenkins
